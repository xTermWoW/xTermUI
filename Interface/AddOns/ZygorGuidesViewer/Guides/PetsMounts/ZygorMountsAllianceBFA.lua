|tip If there is a 0 in your code, skip petting that cat.
|tip If your code is only 4 digits, (for example you only took 1,132 damage), add a 0 to the front so it's 5 digits, making your code 01132 (so you'd skip petting the first cat).
|tip When a cat is pet the cat will receive one stack of "Purring."
